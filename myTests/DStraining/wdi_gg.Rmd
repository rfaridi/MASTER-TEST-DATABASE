Question
========
Use the data from the question where you have extracted the data of GDP per capita of Bangaladesh, Bolivia and Kenya for the last year in the data.

Answerlist
----------
* Draw a bar diagram of this GDP data with different colors for each country (particularly "green" for Bangladesh, "red" for Bolivia and "blue" for Kenya).
* Bonus point for those who can come up with a horizontal Bar diagram. 
* More bonus points for those who can come up with pie chart from the same data.

Solution
========

(a)  A subset of the data has to be created for the year the bar diagram will be drawn. The following code will do that 
```r{eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
dat.sub <- subset(data=dat, 
		  subset=year==2014, 
		  filter=c("countries","gdppc"))  
```
 Then following command will create the bar plot
```
p <- ggplot(dat.sub,aes(x=countries,y=gdppc))+
		geom_bar(stat="identity")
```
