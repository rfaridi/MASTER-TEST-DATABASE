# Week 1

## week1-lec1-introduction

- what is the difference between statistics and a statistic?
- what is the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential
  statistics?
- what is a statistic? how context plays a role in calculating a statistic
- what is statistics and what is the goal of statistics? 

## week1-lec2-five-number-summary

- Please find the five-point summary of the following numbers (odd numbers):
- mention the R commands used to find the five-point summary
- Instead if you were asked just to find the median of those numbers which
  command you would have used? 
- what is the advantage of boxplot over the five point summary? 
- now do the same for a bunch of numbers where the total number is even
- Explain how did you calculate quartiles when total number is odd
- Explain how did you calculate quartiles when total number is even

## week1-lec3-the-center-of-data

- what is the difference between a regular boxplot and modified boxplot?
- what is IQR? how do you calculate IQR?
- how do you calculate the lower and higher inner fences?
- what would be definition of a robust statistic?
- Among mean, IQR, standard deviation and median, which is(are) robust
  statistic?
- what is trimmed mean? how do you calculate a trimmed mean?
- for the following numbers, calculate the trimmed mean manually 
- then compare it with the designated trim function. Do they match? 
- Evaluate the following statement: trimmed mean is a more robust statistic than
  median
- Import the Red Bulls salary data into R. then calculate five point summary and
  draw the boxplot
- Is there anything unusual about the data? Describe.
- What would you suggest about the data to get more meaningful five-point
  summary? 
- Compare the median,mean,IQR in original data set and trimmed data set. 

## week1-lec4-spread-of-data

- what is the limitation of range and IQR as a measure of spread of data?
- how do we calculate standard deviaton? you don't have to write any formula.
  just write down in plain words the basic idea.
- what is degree of freedom?  what role does degree of freedom plays in finding
  variance?
- why variance or standard deviaton is a better measure of spread than range and
  IQR?
- From the NY bulls salary data, calculate the variance and standard deviation.
- Manually calculate the mean and standard deviation and compare it with from
  the designated functions in R. 
- From the NY bulls salary data, evaluate the statement that variance and
  standard deviation both are robust statistics.

## week1-lec5-shape-of-data

- why a histogram is useful?
- What is the the difference between unimodal and bimodal distribution? what is
  the implication of this difference?
- Boxplot misses an important feature in the case of bimodal distribution.
  Evaluate the statement. 
- In the case of LE data, find the histogram and answer the following:
- is it unimodal?
- is it left-skewed, right-skewed or symmetric?
- Let's say following is the five point summary of student's grade in a class. Are the grades symmetric or skewed? Explain your answer. 
- In the case of skeleton data, find the histogram and answer the following:
- is it unimodal?
- is it left-skewed, right-skewed or symmetric?
- In the case of NY bulls data, find the histogram and answer the following:
- is it unimodal?
- is it left-skewed, right-skewed or symmetric?
- in the case of NY bulls data, check out whether empirical rule works or not
- in the case of LE data, check out whether empirical rule works or not
- in the case of skeleton data, check out whether empirical rule works or not
- in left-skewed data, what would be the relationship between mode, mean and
  median? explain your answer.
- in right-skewed data, what would be the relationship between mode, mean and
  median? explain your answer.

## week1-lec6-categorical-vars

- which are the categorical variables in LE data set?
- which are the categorical variables in skeleton data set?
- which are the categorical variables in NY Bulls data set?
- What are the ways to describe categorical variables?
- Find a bar chart for a categorical variable in LE data set.
- Find a bar chart for a categorical variable in skeleton data set.
- Find a bar chart for a categorical variable in NY bulls data set set.

## week1-lec7-some-features-of-data
- how do you define observational units. Cite example from LE, NY bulls,
  skeleton data.
- how do you define a variable. Cite example from LE, NY bulls,
- Evaluate the statement - you can find summary statistics for ordinal variables
- what is the difference between ordinal variable and categorical variable?
- what is the difference between ordinal variable and numerical variable? 
- Evaluate the statement: outliers can be discarded from the data to have
  meaningful data analysis.
- Evaluate the statement: missing values can be discarded from the data to have
  meaningful data analysis. 

# Week 2


### how do you define marginal distribution? Find the value of relative frequency of marginal distribution of BMI=overweight from the joint distribution of BMI and Sex variables. What is the value of relative frequency of joint distribtuion a male overweight person? 

### How do you define conditional distribution?  Find the value of conditional distribution of a normal person given that sex of that person is female. 

### Is sex variable independent of BMI? Explain. 

### What is Simpson's paradox? Explain with example. 

### Name the methods to select a random sample. Why the sample has to be random in the first place?

### Suppose you have opened a poll in Facebook to understand how people of Bangladesh think on a certain issue. Do you think the people who will respond to this poll will form a representative sample? Why or why not? What kind of biases this poll may create?
